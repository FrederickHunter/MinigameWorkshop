1. Demons & Ufos
2. You are in a box shaped spaceship and you are trapped on a strange alien planet where demons from the right towards you on random spaces at randomized speed values while UFOs sometimes quickly charge at you from above.
3. Use WASD or the arrow keys to move but you're horizontal movement speed as well as how far left or right you can go is randomized.
4. Avoid the demons and UFOs if you get hit they will capture and destroy you.
5. I made long worm-like demons spawn from the right at random times, spaces, and speed values same with UFOs that spawn on the top. I even made the main character you control only be able to go so far on the left and right and at random speed values.
6. I used the UNITY 3d gameshapes to help make the characters, the ship is a cube, the demons are elongated capsules, and the UFOs are flat spheres.
